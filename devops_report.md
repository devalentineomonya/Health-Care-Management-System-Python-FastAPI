# DevOps Implementation Report

This document summarizes the current DevOps and deployment considerations for the Health Care Management System project.

Containerization
- Dockerfiles are present (`Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.notification`). Build images for the API server and notification worker.
- Use multi-stage builds to keep images small and secure.

Docker Compose
- `docker-compose.yml` defines services for the API and (optionally) dependencies. Use for local dev and integration testing.

Environments & Secrets
- Keep secrets out of VCS. Use environment variables and a secrets manager (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) for production.
- Example local env file: `.env` (never commit to repo).

CI/CD Recommendations
- Use GitHub Actions (recommended) with the following pipelines:
  - lint & unit tests (on PR)
  - build image and push to registry (on merge to main)
  - deploy to staging (on merge to main)

Suggested pipeline steps
1. Checkout code
2. Set up Python (3.10/3.11)
3. Install dependencies
4. Run linters (flake8/ruff) and unit tests (pytest)
5. Build Docker image and push to registry (Docker Hub / GitHub Container Registry)
6. Deploy to target environment (SSH, Kubernetes, or cloud provider)

Monitoring & Logging
- Add structured logs (JSON) and collect with a central log system (ELK / Loki / Datadog).
- Add healthchecks and metrics (Prometheus) for endpoints and background workers.

Scaling & Production
- Deploy behind a reverse proxy/load balancer.
- For scale, use Kubernetes or a managed container service. Run multiple replicas of the API and workers; use a shared message broker or DB locking for job coordination.

Security
- Enforce HTTPS in production via proxy/ingress.
- Ensure database credentials and API secrets are rotated and scoped minimally.

Rollback & Disaster Recovery
- Keep deployment artifacts tagged with commit SHAs.
- Support quick rollback by redeploying a previous tag.
